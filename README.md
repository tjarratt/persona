Persona
=======

An experimental Github Honeypot generator

## Thesis

Ever since I started contributing daily to projects on github I noticed a sharp uptick in recruiters spamming me with "job offers" that are really just offers to interview. I believe these recruiters are spamming hundreds if not thousands of developers hoping to find a few willing to earn their commission.

## Goal
The vision I have of Persona is of a fully automated, pushbutton system for generating a new persona on github, complete with back-dated history, email, etc. Once this reaches a proof of concept stage, I plan on generating a lot of these and waiting to see what I can catch with my honeypot.
